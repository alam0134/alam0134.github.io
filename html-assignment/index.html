        <br>
        <p>Hello, my name is <em>Didarul Alam</em>. I am an international student here in Canada studying in <em>Interactive Media design</em>. I came to Canada 24<sup>th</sup>April 2024. I love to design Websites and Apps. I want to be a Ui Ux designer in future and start my own business in this industry. That's why i am at Algonquin College to enrice my potential. I met some amazing professors and fellow students, who are helping me to kick off my journey.</p>
        <p>In my leasure time i love to read books and learn more about my field. It gives me a sense of happiness. In this course i am not only learning the skills also how to use those skills. Even these days i am giving a lot of my time to learn the fundamentals of Web design and coding. And frankly speaking its so pleasurable.</p>
