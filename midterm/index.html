            <h2>Life of Cat</h2>
            <p>Reliable information on the lifespans of domestic cats is varied and limited. Nevertheless, a number of studies have investigated the matter and have come up with noteworthy estimates. Estimates of mean lifespan in these studies range between 13 and 20 years, with a single value in the neighborhood of 15 years. At least one  study found a median lifespan value of 14 years and a corresponding interquartile range of 9  to 17 years. Maximum  lifespan  has been estimated at values ranging from 22 to 30 years although there have been claims of cats living longer than 30 years. According to the 2010 edition of the Guinness World Records, the oldest cat ever recorded was Creme Puff, who died in 2005, aged 38 years, 3 days.   Female cats typically outlive male cats, and crossbred cats typically outlive purebred cats.It has also been found that the greater a cat's weight, the lower its life expectancy on average. The current oldest verified cat alive is Flossie, who was born in 1995 in England, United Kingdom.A cat’s average lifespan increased by a year over the span of time between 2002 and 2012, according to a study by Banfield Pet Hospital.</p>
